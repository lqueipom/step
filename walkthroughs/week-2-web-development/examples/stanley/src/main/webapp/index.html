      <p>I was born and raised in Venezuela, a place that has transformed from a place of beauty and 
	progress into one of poverty and crime. Because of its troubles, I learned to be resilent,
	resourceful, and a problem-solver. My situation ignited a desired to improve the quality of my
	life and of those around me. Hence, I decided to study abroud and seek a place where I would
	learn strong fundamentals and truly grow.</p>

      <h2>Hidden Talent</h2>
      <p>I do not know if it is very much hidden, but I love drawing cartoons! I have done
	it since I was a little girl and every birthday that my family members or close friends 
	have I try to make their day a bit better with a drawing of their favorite childhood show.
	(I certainly hope so!)</p>
