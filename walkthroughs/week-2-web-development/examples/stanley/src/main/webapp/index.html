      <h1>Laura's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is Laura, I am a rising junior at MIT. I am currently majoring in Computer Science. 
	I was born and raised in Venezuela and moved to the US to pursue higher education.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Worked at the University of Catalonia on an Autism related project</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I mostly use photographing to keep almost as a diary of my life. For me to 
	remember what I was up to during those times. So, my photographs are mainly me
	with my friends, family, or of places that I was lucky to visit (Brazil,
	Romania, Argentina, Spain). </p>

      <h2>Hidden Talent</h2>
      <p>I do not know if it is very much hidden, but I love drawing cartoons! I have done
	it since I was a little girl and every birthday that my family members or close friends 
	have I try to make their day a bit better with a drawing of their favorite childhood show.
	(I certainly hope so!)</p>
